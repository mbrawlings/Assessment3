        <h1>American Fork</h1>
        <p>I've lived in American Fork for the majority of my life. American Fork has been
            growing tremendously over that past 10 years will all the tech companies coming
            into the Lehi area. Because of that, it has grown in popularity.
        </p>
        <h2>Climbing</h2>
        <p>Salt Lake City has become one of the biggest climbing hubs in the nation. As the sport
            grows, more and more people move to Salt Lake because of it's amazing access to local 
            climbing areas. American Fork Canyon is one of those climbing areas. Originally established
            in the 80s and 90s, American Fork was considered world class at the time because of it's difficult 
            movement and unique limestone caves.
