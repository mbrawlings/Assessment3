            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of coding, I would say that my biggest interest is rock climbing.
                Nearly every day I'm either at the gym climbing/training or at the gym working
                out so I can be stronger for climbing. Weekends are usually where it all comes
                together and I get to go on a day trip to a climbing area and work on climbs that
                mean a lot to me. Here's a picture of me on one of my most favorite climbs I've 
                ever climbed:

            <h2>Career goals</h2>
            <p>Coding has slowly become more and more a part of my life over the past year or so.
                I've always been a natural problem solver and have always loved implementing that 
                skill in my life. Coding is something that feels both hard and progressive. I'm excited
                to work on a development team where I can work with other in order to solve problems
                and make progress on company and team goals. Here's a condensed list of my career goals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn Swift well enough so I can submit my own app</li>
                <li>Land a job at a tech company that aligns with my personal values</li>
                <li>Work remotely so I can maintain the work-life balance I'm looking for</li>
                <li>Develop strong relationships with my team members</li>
                <li>Continue to learn more and more each day I'm working</li>
            </ul>
